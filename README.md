# colemickens/**nixcfg**

This is my nix configuration files for all of my various nix endeavors.

This has a variety of dependenices on various branches of my fork of nixpkgs.
Generally I try to keep the commits I carry light, upstreaming as much as possible.
My primary branch is `cmpkgs`. (As of 2018-10-18, the other in-use or in-progress branches are `sway`, `kata`, `plex`.)

More stuff.
